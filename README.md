# networkExpansion
code for network expansion

Network expansion is an iterative method for generating metabolic networks starting from a set of "seed" compounds (metabolites).  The algorithm adds metabolites iteratively, according to a set of allowable reactions, until convergence.  The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.
