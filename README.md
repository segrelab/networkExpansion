# networkExpansion
code for network expansion

Network expansion is an iterative method for generating metabolic networks starting from a set of "seed" compounds (metabolites).  The algorithm adds metabolites iteratively, according to a set of allowable reactions, until convergence.  The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.  


An example script to run network expansion is provided in the examples directory.  For more information on the method and implementation, see the supporting information within the paper:
